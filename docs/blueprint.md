# **App Name**: Content Alchemist

## Core Features:

- Content Planning: AI-Driven Content Strategy: Uses AI to analyze trends, suggest topics, and identify optimal content formats.
- Component Generation: Interactive Component Generation: Generates learning activities using instructional design algorithms. It is a tool that may incorporate external data as needed.
- Quality Check: Automated Quality Assurance: AI checks for mission alignment and content validation using defined metrics.
- Workflow Display: Workflow Visualization: Displays the content creation process with AI actions highlighted.
- Feedback Loop: User Collaboration: Allows users to accept, modify, or reject AI suggestions with collaborative editing features.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White or light gray for a clean, modern look.
- Secondary color: Dark blue (#003049) for headers and important elements.
- Accent: Teal (#40E0D0) to highlight interactive elements and AI suggestions.
- Clear and readable sans-serif fonts for all text.
- Consistent and professional icon set representing content types and actions.
- Dashboard layout with clear sections for content creation, AI suggestions, and workflow visualization.
- Subtle animations to indicate AI processing and content updates.

## Original User Request:
# Agentic AI in the Content Development Workflow App

Based on the repository files I've reviewed, I can clarify where the agentic AI should run in the app for implementing the AI Hub Content Development Workflow.

## The Agentic AI Component

In the simple app I described earlier, I didn't explicitly include the agentic AI component that would power the workflow. Here's how the agentic AI should be integrated:

### Core Agentic AI Implementation

The agentic AI should be implemented as the central intelligence that powers the workflow automation in your app. According to your repository files:

1. **Workflow Orchestration**: The agentic AI should run as part of the "Workflow Orchestration" component mentioned in your architecture_diagram.md:
   - "Manages the overall content creation process"
   - "Coordinates between different services and agents"
   - "Handles state management and transitions"

2. **Technical Implementation**: Based on the implementation_plan.md, the agentic AI would be deployed as Cloud Run services:
   - Research Service
   - Citation Service
   - Quality Service
   - Review Service

### Specific Workflow Components

The agentic AI should implement these key workflow components from the Enhanced_Agentic_AI_Content_Creation_Workflow.md:

1. **Content Planning**:
   - "AI-Driven Content Strategy"
   - "Knowledge Graph Integration"
   - "Audience Analysis using NLP-based persona matching"

2. **Practical Components Development**:
   - "Comprehensive Learning Activity Design"
   - "Interactive Component Generation"
   - "Activity Design using instructional design algorithms"

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Automated checks for mission alignment
   - Content validation and verification

## App Implementation Recommendations

To implement this in the simple app I described earlier:

1. **Backend AI Services**: 
   - Implement the agentic AI as serverless functions or microservices
   - Connect these services to your frontend through APIs

2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Add an "AI Assistant" panel that shows the agentic AI's current actions
   - Provide controls to adjust AI parameters and workflow settings
   - Display AI-generated suggestions and content

3. **Workflow Visualization**:
   - Add a workflow diagram showing the current stage in the process
   - Highlight dependencies being managed by the agentic AI
   - Show progress through the four phases outlined in AI_Hub_Content_Development_Workflow.md

4. **User Collaboration Features**:
   - Allow users to accept, modify, or reject AI suggestions
   - Enable feedback loops to improve the AI's performance
   - Support collaborative editing between human team members and the AI

## Technical Architecture

The app should follow the implementation architecture outlined in your Enhanced_Agentic_AI_Content_Creation_Workflow.md:

1. **Compute Resources**:
   - GPU clusters for model inference
   - Distributed processing for research and verification

2. **Storage Systems**:
   - Content repository
   - Knowledge base
   - Media asset management

3. **User Interfaces**:
   - Content Creator Interface with workflow dashboard
   - Reviewer Interface with annotation tools
   - Administrator Interface for system configuration

By implementing these components, your app would effectively leverage agentic AI to automate and enhance the content development workflow described in your documentation.
